    **🔺 This automation is not resposible a safety feature. It con only support your efford to improve your alarm system. Be advised that this automation does not promise to work flawlessly but will try to. Using this automation is on your own risk.**
    
    **If the hub or the your automation system is down the linkage will not work. 🔺**

    ## Introduction

    This blueprint automation allows you to link the Aqara Smoke Detector JY-GZ-01AQ because it does not link itself to eachother directly even the official documents might lead you to this conclusion. Linking is either done by the Aqara hub or has to be implemented in your home automation system.

    This blueprint is inspired by the following blueprint creations. Thanks to these developers.

    <summary><strong>Device self-tests</strong></summary>

    To test your smoke alarm devices you can conduct a self-test by using either the hardware button on a device or use the software self-test button. When using the hardware button you need to hold it for at least 3 seconds and continue a few more after the test started. The hardware button is not relyable probably because of
    the deep sleep capability of the device.

    During this self-test you will receive mobile notifications that ask you to continue the self-test of ever associate smoke detector one-by-one. You will have time in between to advanve to the next detector. The assigned area will be shown in the notification.

    <strong>🔆</strong> When selecting the smoke detectors here in the automation you should order them in a way that makes it easy for you to go from one to the next efficiantly.

    </details>
    
    <details>
    <summary><strong>Fake fire alarm test</strong></summary>

    This automation implements a fake fire alarm test. You can disable this test in the settings if you do not want to use this feature instead using special testing gas.

    After the self-test you will be asked to conduct a "real" fire alarm test. This alarm uses the same sequence as if a smoke detector triggers this automation by detecting smoke. This is a special feature of this blueprint since using using seperate sequences would not serve the purpose at all.

    To avoid confusion you should definetly prepare everyone in your household that you are about to do this test. For recipients of smoke alarm messages these will have a forced prefix and suffix <code>!TEST!</code> in the title.

    ## 🔺 Important 🔺

    The following notes are limitation of the device or the protocol and not of the automation!

    <strong>The Aqara smoke detector is a zigbee battery device and therefor in deep sleep mode most of the time. Hence, status updates and actions might not change immediately. It might even take a long time before an alarm or mute command is executed.</strong>

    <strong>Also, if you send an alarm command and later a mute before the device reacted to the alarm command, the mute command will most likely be ignored. You need to send a new mute command.</strong>
    
    <strong>There are mentions that a regular change of the hearbeat indicator switch is keeping the deviceawake to react promptly. This is not yet tested by me. I will keep you posted on my findings.</strong>

    1. You need to activate <code>linkage_alarm</code> to make the automation work!
    2. If you want the areas to show on the notification you need to assign the smoke detectors to an area.
    3. If you use the hardware self-test button you need to push it a few seconds longer after you already hear the test sounds. Otherwise it might not send its status to Home Assistant.
    4. If you use the hardware Self-Test button on the device the automation might not run the first time. This is probably due to the deep sleep mode of the device. If you do not receive a notification on a correctly setup system just try it again after a short wait.

        A timeout is configurable for this notification after which the alarm **will** be propagated unless you have chosen an action on the notification.
